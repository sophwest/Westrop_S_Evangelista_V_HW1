Sophia: My name is Sophia, I am person 1. I'm not experienced with coding but I'm hoping to get really good at it. I've always wanted to learn how to code and program, I took computer science for 2 years in high school and we learned Java and I thought it was fun but it was a little hard. I also like Pokemon, my favourite Pokemon is Slowpoke. I also love doing digital art.
